This is the official source code for the Open Google Calendar (Thunderbird).

It's a fork of repository archived : https://github.com/clarkbw/google-calendar-tab by Bryan Clark
but compatible with Thunderbird Version 60.*

I don't take feature requests or fix bugs (that I don't see myself) so if you'd like something done you have to contribute. And thanks! :-)

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how you can help.
